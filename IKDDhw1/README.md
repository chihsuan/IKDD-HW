## Performance testing of relational databases

Database performance is the key to the success of your service against the demand surge. As you may know, there are many issues that will impact the database performance. We list some issues (but not limited) here:

1. clustered/distributed or not (you can check postgreSQL vs. postgreSQL Cluster)
2. Client/Server in Intranet or not (within the same hub; within the same router..)
3. Client/Server in localhost or not
4. in a virtual machine or physical machine
5. in various VM hypervisors
6. cloud or not (you can check salesforce solution: www.database.com)
7. in SSD or not
8. in Linux/Windows/Mac
9. various database engines (e.g., mysql, postgreSQL, â€¦etc)

Requirement:
1. Your report must contain description of your testing environments.
2. At least two environments should be tested in your report.
3. Email your report (in PDF) to ktchuang@mail.ncku.edu.tw (also cc to TA: sydang.ncku@gmail.com). 
4. You can revise your report at most thrice.
5. Chines/English are both accepted.
6. Note that we will upload your report in github and index in the course website (We also highly encourage you to upload your report and related code to your github). It may have the butterfly effect to your future.
